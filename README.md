# developyzza
The original python branch of DeveloPizza. DO NOT USE

This repo only exists for archival purposes. It is an archive of the original python script used to run DeveloPizza, which is now JPizza. 
The code is heavily outdated and doesn't support most modern JPizza features. It runs poorly and I would heavily avoid using this.
